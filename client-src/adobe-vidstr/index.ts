                    I was recruited by my Adobe mentors Stephen DiVerdi and Mackenzie Leake to work on the video composition retargeting problem.
                    Let's first define what a video composition is:
                    <br><br>
                    <div style="padding: 2rem; background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)">
                        A document in any digital editing
                        video tool comprising of a single
                        video with multiple graphical elements placed on top, appearing
                        at times and in positions that are ‚Äúaligned‚Äù with the content of the
                        video.
                    </div>
                    <br><br>
                    Video composition retargeting is the process of taking a video composition and adapting it to a new video.
                    For instance I have an original video take and I swap it out for a new take (e.g. bad hair day). 
                    The act of <b>realigning the graphics of the composition</b> is what we mean whem we say "retargeting".
                </div>
                <div class="vertical-line"></div>
            </div>

                    Why is this important? Again, consider the very common scenario where you swap an old video for a new video.
                    The new video potentially has many differences (e.g. speech cadence, wordings, performer) 
                    that force the editor to redo their edits.
                    This is a time-consuming process that can be automated with AI.

                    Video editing spans a wide range of workflows and output formats. 
                    Instead of supporting every possible video editing workflow, we chose to focus the project to a specific use case:
                    speech-driven performances. This is a common media format on social media.
                    <br><br>

                        Scoping the project to a compelling subset of the problem space
                        is necessary for a successful 12-week internship. 
                        Planning out the project scope sets clear expectations and achievable deadlines.
                    </div>
                    <br><br>
                    Importantly, speech-driven performances mean that the video content is driven by the performer's speech.
                    Therefore we can use the speech content to inform the retargeting process.
                    Similarly a performer is a simple region of interest to avoid to do (geometric) content awareness. 
                    <br><br>
                    On the right are examples of the speech-driven performance videos we target in this project.

                    With speech-driven video, we can work with a transcript representation with per-word timestamps.
                    Starting off simple, I tried an n-grams approach where each word votes on where an asset should appear in the new transcript.
                    This was also combined with voting on gesture movement symbols.
                    Each vote is a gaussian "splat" that we sum to get a likelihood distribution to maximize.
                    <br><br>
                    While this approach worked for naive retargeting scenarios, it was not robust to more complex changes such as synonym rewording,
                    speech cadence changes, and ordering/content changes.
                    This got me thinking about what tool or representation was richer and more flexible than rigid n-grams.

                        I constructed prompts to instruct an LLM to perform retargeting by finding "corresponding locations" for assets &mdash;

                        <br><br>
                        Natural language is a rich but ambigious representation over code and precision over word choice was key to reliable model performance.

                    The LLM was able to find corresponding locations for assets in the new transcript through keyword and surrounding sentence matching.
                    It addressed all the n-gram issues with ease and we moved ahead with this approach.

                    Next, the spatial retargeting problem is fundamentally a geometric problem 
                    between the bounding boxes of our graphical assets and key regions of interest (i.e. the performer).
                    Finding an optimal layout is challenging due to exponential constraint considerations as the number of assets increase.
                    <br><br>
                    Brainstorming ideas with my mentor Steve, we imagined geometric transformations based around mirroring 
                    and preserving white-space ratios would work with individual assets. 
                    However, how would multi-asset compositions work?

                    Back in Spring 2023, I took a course on linear programming in the context of polytope theory.
                    This <b>obscure knowledge came in handy</b> when I discovered that all the auto-layout algorithm literature was based on linear programming derivatives.
                    <br><br>

                        My niche interest in polytope theory allowed me to quickly understand and extend a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approach to our problem.
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    The key to MILPs is they separate optimization of a problem's objective from a problem's constraints. 
                    This comes at the expense of infeasible solutions which can be dealt with a relaxation schedule.
                    Here I set up the problem to individually position each asset with geometric rules (covered in 3A) and resolve conflicts all at once with padding.
                    Therefore we find the layout closest to composition-preserving locations!

                    This meant that we had a chance to address the reviewers' comments and resubmit the paper for a second round of review.

                    I conducted expert interviews to address (1) and gather more feedback to strengthen our understanding of how VidSTR was and was not helpful to video editors.
                    Some rewriting was necessary to address (2), and I ran experiments comparing LLM benefits over dynamic time warping for (3).
